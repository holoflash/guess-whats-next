# guess-whats-next
A simple game I made to test what I've learned about HTML,CSS and JavaScript so far.

The game is played by trying to guess which of the three words; "guess", "what's" or "next", the computer will pick next. If the player's choice matches the computer's selection - one point is awarded to the player, if not - the score is reset to zero. The high-score is updated when: "score" > "high-score", and is reset to zero when the page is refresehd.

My record is 7 correct guesses in a row. I achieved it by rapidly pressing only one of the options, which isn't very fun gameplay. The computer selection is made using the math.random() function, which I'm finding a little too random for the game to be fun. The U.I. might be a little confusing at the moment as it is not very clear what the player is supposed to do.
